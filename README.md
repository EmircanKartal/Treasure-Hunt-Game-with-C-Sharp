# Treasure Hunt Game with C#
## Overview
The project involves designing a game where an autonomous character navigates a map to collect treasures efficiently. Object-oriented programming principles and data structures are applied for this purpose.

## Introduction
The game's development was carried out in Visual Studio, with the decision to display the game on form windows. The project required organizing obstacles and treasure chests into separate lists and placing them on the map.

## File and Class Structure
The project features a well-organized file and class structure:

```GameClass.cs:``` Defines fundamental game components such as character, obstacles, and treasure chests.

```GameForm.cs:``` Manages user interface, game loop, and visual representations of the game.
## Usage
To play the game, execute the .exe file located in the ```Treasure-Hunt-Game-with-C-Sharp/TreausreHuntVS/bin/Debug/``` directory.
